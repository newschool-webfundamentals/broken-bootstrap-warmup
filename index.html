          <h2>Smoking in the Courtyard</h2>
          <p>
            It's a chilly day for the first of April, but in the Lang courtyard, a group of three friends laugh together while smoking cigarettes. While many students at Lang complain about a lack of community, it seems the students in the courtyard are having no trouble bonding with one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the smokers wears a bright yellow baseball cap with a matching yellow sweater tied around his shoulders. He seems cheerful despite the cool air in what's supposed to be spring time.
